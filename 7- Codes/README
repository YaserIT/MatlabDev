This repository implements an enhanced heart disease prediction method using multi-objective optimization
techniques—genetic algorithm, gray wolf, particle swarm, and bee colony optimization—for wrapper-based feature
selection on the UCI heart disease dataset. The selected features are fed into classification models including KNN,
SVM, ANN, and Naïve Bayes to accurately predict cardiovascular disease.
