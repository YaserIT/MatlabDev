Using an Integrated Predictive Model with Multi-Objective Optimization
This paper introduces an enhanced method for heart disease prediction by integrating multi-objective optimization techniques
for wrapper-based feature selection. Using a UCI heart disease dataset, the approach applies four multi-objective optimization
algorithms—genetic algorithm, gray wolf optimization, particle swarm optimization, and bee colony optimization—to identify
significant features. These features are then used as input to classification models, including K-nearest neighbors,
support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and Naïve Bayes, to predict cardiovascular disease.
